# Jenkins: Freestyle Project vs Pipeline Project

## **1. Freestyle Project**
Freestyle Project is the simplest and most basic type of project in Jenkins, suitable for beginners. In a Freestyle Project, you can easily define different steps such as compile, test, and deploy manually via Jenkins' user interface. Plugins can also be added to extend its capabilities.

**Features:**
- Quick and simple configuration.
- Suitable for small projects and simple tasks.
- Less flexibility for complex projects.

## **2. Pipeline Project**
Pipeline Project allows you to define your CI/CD processes using code. This code is known as the *Jenkinsfile*, which specifies the stages like build, test, and deploy. Pipelines are highly flexible and ideal for large and complex projects.

**Features:**
- Define and execute stages as code (*Pipeline as Code*).
- Jenkinsfile can be version-controlled alongside project code (e.g., in Git).
- Supports complex scripting and conditional controls for better process management.
- Two syntax types: *Declarative* and *Scripted*.

## **Key Differences**
| Feature               | Freestyle Project                     | Pipeline Project                    |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Flexibility**       | Limited                              | Highly flexible                     |
| **Version Control**   | Not supported                        | Supported via Jenkinsfile           |
| **Complexity**        | Suitable for simple tasks            | Ideal for complex projects          |
| **Automation**        | Manual configuration via UI          | Fully automated through code        |

## **Which One to Choose?**
- Use **Freestyle Project** for simple, quick tasks or when you're starting out.
- Use **Pipeline Project** for more complex projects that require precise automation and version control.
